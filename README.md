<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The problem lies in the effort that people make to buy metro tickets. Besides that, Many people who do not usually use the Metro regularly have issues when they enter the Metro station, they donâ€™t know which line and which direction they should follow to reach their destination station.
In addition to all that mentioned, People usually stuck in routine queues in order to create a metro subscription or to renew it.

Our project solve these problems as below:

* Handle all the process of reserving a ticket by the mobile app. Use mobile phones instead of Metro smart cards for subscriptions and handle the process of activating or renewing the subscription by the mobile application.
* Allow users to find the station they want and provide a described sequence of stations he/she should follow from the start station to their final station.
* Let the users easily charge his balance using a secured payment method. Handle the ticket or subscription validation process by using QR Code technology instead of normal tickets.
* Develop some features to make the application better and more usable. Our Mobile Application is implemented by Flutter framework to be accessible to every smartphone which supports either Android or IOS Operating Systems.
